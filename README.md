sudoku-sandbox
==============
There are two projects here: 2012-09, which was an early attempt at counting how many solved sudoku grids exist (as well as generating them,) and 2013-09, which is a simple, to the point brute force sudoku grid generator.

Both projects are "thinking code" and not necessarily ready for public consumption; they are more proof-of-concept for some ideas I had rolling around in my head.
